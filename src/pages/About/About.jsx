        <p className="about__header">Our Mission:</p>
        <p className="about__text">
          From a young age, our founder held a deep reverence for our planet,
          firmly believing that individual happiness contributes to a happier
          Earth. At HappyFIT, we're driven by the philosophy that "Healthy
          people = Happy people = Happy world = Healthy world." This mission
          embodies the idea that personal transformation and inner harmony have
          the power to heal not just individuals but the entire world.
        </p>
        <p className="about__header">Our Inspiration:</p>
        <p className="about__text">
          "If you restore balance in your own self, you will be contributing
          immensely to the healing of the world." ‚Äî Deepak Chopra{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="about__text">
          These words resonate profoundly with us, encapsulating the essence of
          our guiding principle. Our journey at HappyFIT is rooted in the belief
          that we must care for ourselves first to find happiness and, in doing
          so, restore balance to our world.

        <p className="about__header">Finding Balance:</p>
        <p className="about__text">
          In a fast-paced world, it's easy to neglect our well-being while
          focusing on external matters. However, this quote reminds us of the
          importance of self-care and self-reflection. By nurturing our
          physical, mental, and emotional health, we become more compassionate,
          resilient, and aware individuals. When we are in balance, we radiate
          positivity, kindness, and understanding towards others, inspiring and
          uplifting those around us.
        </p>

          By prioritizing our own well-being and embarking on a journey of
          self-restoration, we not only enhance our lives but also have the
          potential to positively impact the world. Our personal equilibrium
          influences our interactions with others, shapes the environment we
          inhabit, and inspires transformative change. Let us embrace this quote
          as our guiding principle, striving for inner balance as a means to
          contribute to the healing and betterment of our global community.
